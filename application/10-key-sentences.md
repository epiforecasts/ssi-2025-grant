# Implementation key sentences

1. We will create a single entry point for R packages across epinowcast and epiforecasts organisations in order to create a coherent ecosystem with clear signposts for users.
1. We will seek user and developer feedback on the divergent user interfaces across packages in order to enable standardisation.
2. We will establish formal governance structures for the unified ecosystem in order to support sustainable maintenance, facilitate decision making, and enable broader community participation.
3. We will reduce code duplication across packages in order to improve interoperability and reduce technical debt.
4. We will implement shared components and common backends across packages in order to enable future integration with next-generation probabilistic programming frameworks such as Turing.jl and create sustainable pathways for maintenance.
5. We will develop contribution guides and onboarding materials in order to expand our contributor pool and distribute maintenance responsibility across a diverse community.
6. We will create infrastructure that facilitates communication across the ecosystem in oder to support community-driven packages and diverse contributors.

# Problem key sentences

1. We need to address the fragmentation of infectious disease modelling tools across our organisations so that users can discover and apply appropriate methods without confusion.
2. We need to standardise interfaces between packages developed during the pandemic so that we can reduce technical debt and improve maintainability.
3. We need to establish clear governance and contribution pathways so that the ecosystem can grow beyond its current developers and evolve to match the needs of users.
4. We need to reduce code duplication across packages with overlapping functionality so that maintenance burden is decreased and bugs are not fixed multiple times in different places.
5. We need to provide unified documentation and support channels so that users can efficiently learn and apply tools for their research and public health needs.
6. We need to create infrastructure that supports community-driven packages and diverse contributors so that the ecosystem can continue to evolve and incorporate innovations from a broad range of users.

# Project key sentence

The project will unify, harmonise, and establish sustainable governance for the epinowcast/epiforecasts ecosystem of infectious disease modelling tools.

# Importance key sentence

Despite widespread usage by public health agencies and researchers, our infectious disease modelling tools are fragmented across two organisations with inconsistent interfaces, overlapping functionality, and distributed maintenance burden, creating barriers to adoption and inefficiencies.

# Promise key sentence

This project will create a unified, sustainable ecosystem with standardised interfaces, shared modular components, and formal governance structures that enable both current maintainers and new contributors to collaborate.

# Next key sentence

We will provide public health agencies and researchers with a more coherent, maintainable set of tools for infectious disease modelling, enabling more effective response to both routine surveillance and emerging threats across diverse global settings.
