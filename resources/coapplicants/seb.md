## Describe how the currently active grants listed above relate to this application.
*If you hold grants related to the topic of this application, explain how these differ and confirm there is no overlap in funding.*
*(200 words maximum)*

*This helps us understand how your application is distinct and does not overlap with research activities already supported by other awards.*

"Modelling and Health Economics" is a broad research unit to improve modelling in the UK, with a focus on applied work rather than methodological innovation. There is no overlap between work proposed there and in this proposal, but an opportunity that developments in the work proposed will support the work done by PhD students to be recruited on the grant.

"Center for Implementation in Outbreak Analytics and Disease Modeling" is an implementation grant with a focus on rolling out existing tools to public health partners, not on methodological innovation or tool development. There is therefore no overlap.

"Real‐time modelling and forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks" is my current Wellcome fellowship. This work was focused purely on testing and evaluating models for real-time forecasting. Our proposal is partly inspired by lessons learned from that project but there is no overlap.

"Epiverse-TRACE" has focused on implementing existing outbreak analysis methods in R for non-expert users. In contrast, this proposal develops new statistical approaches using composable generative models in Julia and probabilistic programming. It concludes in August 2025, and the follow-on funding now in place supports implementation only. The projects are entirely distinct in scope, with no overlap.

**Shaping epidemic modelling through behavioural realism.**
Through mathematical models in which individual behaviour changes in response to an outbreak I demonstrated this can significantly alter epidemic dynamics. It is now firmly established that such effects cannot be ignored when modelling outbreaks, and the collection of behavioural data to inform real-time modelling of infectious diseases has become an established part of epidemic surveillance.

**Enabling rapid and policy-relevant outbreak response.**
I took a leading role in developing real-time forecasting methods during the 2014–16 West African Ebola outbreak, working in collaboration with MSF and WHO. I have since led rapid analyses during other emerging outbreaks, including COVID-19 and mpox, providing early insights into key parameters like the reproduction number, impact of superspreading, and role of contact structure. 

**Forecasting and forecast evaluation**
A main focus of my work over the past years has been the evaluation of real-time infectious disease forecasts, which yielded insights on improving forecasting methods, on the limits of forecasting, as well as furthering evaluation methodology to better reflect epidemiological context. 

**Collaborating across teams to answer pressing questions.**
Good science depends on collaboration. I pride myself on being an effective and generous collaborator in work led by others. I have contributed to several influential studies on SARS-CoV-2 variants, transmission in hospitals and others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I established the European COVID-19 Forecast and Scenario Hubs with the ECDC — platforms that combined model contributions from across the community to inform public health while enabling meta-research on forecasting and scenario modelling.

**Creating tools that support the wider field.**
Knowledge generation in my field goes beyond publications. I have developed and maintained several open-source R packages for infectious disease modelling, with a focus on usability, performance, and reproducibility. These tools are widely used by researchers and public health agencies worldwide and have helped democratise access to advanced modelling techniques.

**Improving the practice and use of modelling.**
I have recently supported work that examined how infectious disease models are used in policy, including multi-country case studies, a scoping review, and research on effective visual communication. These projects provide some of the first evidence on what makes modelling useful in practice and how science–policy connections can be strengthened.

## How have you contributed to the development of others?
*This may include, for example:*

- *mentoring and supervision of students and colleagues, or mentoring others in your field*
- *examples of strategic leadership, how you shaped the direction of a team, organisation, company or institution*
- *your involvement in establishing collaborations.*

I aim to create environments that support others - especially early-career researchers - in developing the skills, networks, and confidence to lead.

I have successfully supervised 5 PhD students to completion as primary supervisor and mentored numerous postdoctoral researchers, many of whom have gone on to have a career both in academia and in public health agencies. I support several early-career researchers as both formal and informal mentor within LSHTM and across institutions. This commitment continues in the current proposal, where the team structure explicitly supports the transition to independence for early-career scientists and career development of more junior ones.

I am currently in my second term as Director of the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID), alongside Kathleen O'Reilly and Yang Liu. In this role I previously focused on building the Centre’s international profile as a vibrant hub for research and teaching. This resulted in the initiation (with Roz Eggo and Graham Medley) of a new community-led conference, IDDconf, and a new short courses on Model Fitting and Inference and Modern Methods of Infectious Disease Modelling. Having recently taken up this role again I am this time focusing on internal support and staff wellbeing, for example through creating a mutual support system for grant and fellowship applications.

I have established collaborations both inside academia and with public health
institutions, including ongoing collaborations with the ECDC and academic partners in the context of the European Forecast and Scenario Hub, with the US CDC and academic partners in US InsightNet, as well as with MSF. In my role as a member of the Technical Advisory Group of the WHO Collaboratory I support collaboration more broadly, aiming to create a global network of support of information exchange around infectious disease analytics.

## How have you contributed to the wider research community?
*This may include, for example:*

- *editing, reviewing, refereeing, and your contributions to the evaluation of researchers and research projects*

I have reviewed numerous grants and papers, and recently became an Academic Editor of PLOS Computational Biology, one of the main specialist journals in our field.

I have played an active role in shaping research agendas through organising knowledge-sharing events. A few years ago I led a successful application for a Royal Society Discussion Meeting on Forecasting Natural and Social Systems, followed by a Satellite Meeting on Forecasting Infectious Disease Incidence for Public Health. These meetings took place in 2023 with more than 40 invited speakers and many more contributing participants, synthesising the state of the field of infectious disease forecasting whilst providing an opportunity for researchers working on forecasts across disciplines to learn from each other.

More recently I have teamed up with colleagues at other institutions (Anne Cori, Freya Shearer and James McCaw) to run a workshop at CIRM, Marseille, on analysis and modelling for the design of future epidemic surveillance systems, to be run for a week at the end of May 2025. The development of the workshop has been driven by the same insights and desire to improve the public health response to outbreaks that led to this application.

I am also committed to improving research culture. In infectious disease modelling, women are well represented at early career stages but underrepresented at senior levels. This points to structural barriers to progression. At LSHTM, I have observed and challenged inconsistencies between formal promotion criteria and their application in practice — particularly the ways in which junior line managers are disadvantaged in promotion processes, which in turn disproportionately affects women and others outside dominant networks. I have made concrete suggestions for reform and continue to advocate for a more transparent, equitable approach to recognition and advancement to support women and other groups that are marginalised in the field.

# Lead applicant research environment details

## Describe how your research contributes to the strategic aims of your organisation.
*(300 words maximum)*
My research directly contributes to LSHTM's mission of improving health and health equity worldwide through excellence in public and global health research and education. LSHTM's mission further aims to ensure that research is widely available in a responsible and secure way, while embracing innovations in data science and technology.

My work in real-time infectious disease modelling is aligned with these strategic priorities. Specifically, my focus on creating open-source, accessible tools aligns with LSHTM's objective to enhance the availability of tools for all. Our approach not only advances LSHTM's commitment to open science but also fosters equitable and sustainable research partnerships globally.

My work specifically tackles infectious diseases as a major challenge in human health including a contribution to pandemic preparedness by using methods from data science and building up capacity on its intersection with epidemiology. This is aligned with the aims of three of the School’s centres, the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID), the Centre for Data and Statistical Science for Health (DASH), and the Centre for Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness (CEPR).

Finally, my work and the work proposed here contributes to LSHTM's vision of a more healthy, sustainable, and equitable world. By providing tools that enable rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks, we support health equity and global preparedness.


## Describe your approach to developing and supporting a positive and inclusive research culture, including examples from previous and current groups. This could include, for example:

- *mentoring*
- *supporting collaboration and interdisciplinarity*
- *leadership and people management*
- *promoting research integrity.*

*Please do not include any sensitive personal information relating to people you have worked with or supported.*
*(500 words maximum)*

I aim to enable a research culture that is inclusive, open, and empowering—one in which people at all career stages feel supported, heard, and valued. I actively welcome feedback on my leadership, and I strive to adapt my approach based on the needs and perspectives of others, including those whose experiences differ from my own.

For example, I have learned a great deal from team members about how best to support neurodiverse colleagues. This has led me to adjust expectations around working patterns and communication styles to better reflect individual needs. I encouraged one colleague to establish a neurodiversity network within our modelling group, which now connects staff with shared experiences and aims to build broader support across LSHTM.

I also promote a culture of transparency and openness in our research practices. Within my group, we routinely share work in progress—not only to maximise scrutiny and rigour, but also to communicate full project lifecycles and normalise mistakes as part of the scientific process. All outputs are accompanied by openly accessible and reproducible code, and we include data wherever possible to support replication and reuse.

I believe that specialist training materials need to be openly accessible to all in order to reduce existing inequities in global analytical capacity. I have led the development of two training courses for infectious disease analysts, one on model fitting and inference and another on nowcasting and forecasting infectious disease dynamics. All material for both of these courses if available for free on-line and under an open license, and feedback has indicated that it is used by researchers worldwide for self-study as well as re-used in teaching by others.

I am committed to mentoring and supporting the progression of junior researchers. As a matter of principle, I offer corresponding authorship to junior first authors on collaborative papers, to help them gain recognition and visibility for their work. I also encourage early career researchers to take on supervisory roles under my mentorship as early as possible as well as senior authorship in resulting publications.

As Director of CMMID, I initiated a PhD student support group, which has since expanded into a wider Early Career Researcher forum. I am now working to extend this support across all career stages, with a particular focus on mid-career staff—many of whom face acute challenges in institutions like LSHTM where permanent positions are limited. These challenges often disproportionately affect researchers with caring responsibilities, and I believe that recognising and addressing these structural issues is essential to building a genuinely inclusive research environment.

## Your organisation will give you and the staff employed on your grant a minimum of 10 days a year to do training and continuing professional development. Explain how you will use this time.
*(300 words maximum)*

*This may include the responsible conduct of research, research leadership, people management, diversity and inclusion, and the promotion of a healthy research culture.*

Team members will use their development time in ways that align with their individual goals, but we anticipate a broad and structured approach that supports both technical skills and professional growth.

We will make active use of LSHTM’s short courses, seminars, and inter-centre workshops to develop research and career skills, including grant writing, fellowship applications, and science communication.

Several group members, including myself, will dedicate time to staying current with developments in probabilistic programming and the Julia ecosystem, including Turing.jl. This will involve hands-on engagement with new tools, participation in relevant user groups, and targeted training as needed. These activities will ensure we are able to take advantage of cutting-edge approaches in composable generative modelling and scalable inference.

For junior staff transitioning to independence, we will encourage participation in LSHTM’s Preparing for Leadership and Management programme and similar offerings. These provide structured support in people management, budgeting, project planning, and inclusive leadership—skills critical for developing a sustainable independent research profile.

I will use part of my own professional development time to strengthen skills in research leadership, inclusive team-building, and people management—particularly in areas such as supporting neurodiverse team members, leading hybrid and distributed teams, and sustaining a positive research culture. I see this as essential to developing as a group leader and mentor.

To support broader capacity-building, we will run regular knowledge-sharing sessions focused on applying probabilistic programming to epidemiological challenges, open to collaborators across participating institutions. These will reinforce a culture of interdisciplinary thinking and continuous learning.

We will also attend and present at interdisciplinary seminars and workshops to stay engaged with current developments across statistics, epidemiology, and computational modelling.

Lastly, as PI I will make sure training is aligned across different parts of the project, ensuring sharing and equality of opportunities within LSHTM and beyond.
