Research Software Maintenance Fund
Welcome to the application portal for the Research Software Maintenance Fund.

The call for expressions of interest for the first round of the Research Software Maintenance Fund opens on Monday 7th April at 10:00 BST and closes on Friday 30th May at 16:00 BST.

The Research Software Maintenance Fund offers £4.8 million to support existing research software. The fund aims to improve how research software is maintained and reduce technical debt, ensuring essential tools remain available to the research community.

Important Information
First round opens: 7 April 2025 (for Expressions of Interest)
First round closes: 30 May 2025 (for Expressions of Interest)
Two award types:
Large Awards of up to £500k for two years (only available in Round 1)
Small Awards of up to £150k for one year (available in all rounds)
Getting Ready
Please visit the Research Software Maintenance Fund website for complete details about the fund, eligibility requirements, and how to apply.

You will need to register for an account if you do not already have one, or login in to your account, using the ”Login or register” box on this page before you can apply. Once logged in, an option for the ”Research Software Maintenance Fund - Round 1” will be available to start your application.

Additional information about how to use the GoodGrants platform for applicants is available.

For specific information about Round 1, visit the Round 1 page.

The Research Software Maintenance Fund is aimed at funding work – particularly around reducing technical debt, improving user experience, and building community – that will improve the sustainability of research software that is hard to find funding for elsewhere. 

The types of work we expect to be funded under this initiative include: 

Technical - updates to code/software: e.g.
Developing components/plugins/integrations to improve interoperability
Improving user experience for end users
Structural improvements to the codebase (refactoring/rearchitecting, scalability, porting, testing)
Community - development of materials or events used to engage users or developers: e.g
Community meetings and outreach to users
Contribution process improvement (including Code of Conduct development)
Sprints, hackathons
Dissemination (including blog posts, case studies)
Documentation - written material used as reference for users and/or developers: e.g. revisions and extensions to
User manuals
Contributor guides
Project website
Tutorials
Training - events or schemes to improve users and/or developers' ability: e.g.
Hosting in-person or virtual courses and workshops
Mentoring new contributors to the project
Governance - activities to improve management and/or sustainability: e.g.
improving governance structures
Developing roadmaps
Work with advisors to improve sustainability/identify business models 
The scheme includes two types of awards: Large Awards of £500k for two years and Small Awards of £150k for one year. All projects must be completed by Tuesday 29 February 2028. 

Applicants must demonstrate that the software(s) they maintain: 

Is beyond the prototype/pilot stage and has had at least one stable release;
Is used by people outside their organisation(s), and is used beyond the immediate collaborators of the software’s developers/wider project team;
Supports research being carried out in the United Kingdom;
Is open to feedback and additional contributors; and
Is committed to developing a roadmap and sustainability/business plan. 
Any software is recommended but not required to be openly licensed, however we encourage all applications to consider how they can improve practices to enable a thriving community of users and contributors.  

Examples of projects that are not likely to be successful if submitted to this fund: 

A project around software in its earlier stages that is not used extensively or known beyond the creator(s);
A project that is focused on improving or supporting a platform or service that has few deployments or low adoption/engagement in its target community;
A project that is widely successful and adopted but has little or no applications to UK research; and
A proposal for a research project primarily using software to create new research results. 
Additional research outputs are not required to be developed as part of the funding, however if they are (e.g. publications, datasets, additional research software) they must follow UKRI’s policy on open research.  

Applications supporting multiple research software projects are encouraged, as are applications that seek to merge or bridge between similar software. 

What you can apply for
Funding can be used to support and maintain existing research software or sustain a team responsible for multiple software tools. However, it is not intended for developing entirely new software, nor is it intended as a continuing source of funding once the grant finishes. 

Acceptable use of funds includes, but is not limited to: 

Salary support for staff (full-time, part-time, or contract): developers, research software engineers, contributors, technical writers, community managers, product managers, project managers, user experience researchers, community educators, or other roles that directly support the software project(s);
Hackathons, sprints, outreach, or other forms of community engagement and support for community participation;
Operational needs such as cloud computing, storage, networking, or continuous integration services; and
Support for work that bridges software projects or ecosystems, including better coordination across software projects that are similar, dependent on one another, or frequently used together. 

Each round will open with a call for Expressions of Interest, which should outline the main idea, the software’s importance and how funding will benefit research. We will check that the proposed work fits the scope and applicants meet the eligibility criteria for this funding. 

These are: 

The work being proposed falls under at least one of the five activity categories: technical, community, documentation, training and governance
The work is focussed on supporting or maintaining existing research software that has a demonstrable user base beyond the software creators
The Project Lead is from an eligible UK research organisation
The team has an appropriate connection with the software
There is an existing connection and expected benefit to UK research
The team understand the other software being used in this area
The team have considered how to measure the impact of the activities  
Successful applicants will then be invited to submit their full proposal detailing planned activities, budget, team experience, and other considerations around community, sustainability and diversity. A panel of experts will identify applications proposing the most significant impact, quality and value while demonstrating feasibility of the proposed work, and will distribute the available funding among those. 

The review panel will be composed to ensure fairness and balance across a range of domain and technical expertise, as well as different roles, levels of seniority and other relevant experience. 

Further details of the assessment process and criteria for the full applications will be published on the SSI website when the full applications stage opens.
