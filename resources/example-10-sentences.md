# Implementation key sentences

1. We will develop epidemiological modules that are composable and treat analysis components as probabilistically linked submodels in order to avoid the errors that arise from combining model outputs without propagating uncertainty.
2. We will apply composable models to diverse data sets in order to systematically evaluate infectious disease models and understand their comparative performance and real-time utility across different data sources.
3. We will revisit early outbreak data to develop models that could have been deployed in real-time in order to establish best practices for using data in future outbreaks.
4. We will use approximate and hybrid inference methods with composable models in order to extend our methods to analysing large, complex clinical and individual-level datasets that maximise scientific value from infectious disease surveillance.
5. We will develop methods to inform population-level models with individual-level observations to learn about relevant transmission parameters in order to evaluate the impact of model assumptions on real-time estimates.
6. We will make these methods available to the wider research community as well as public health practitioners using data to understand infectious disease transmission in order to translate our methodological advances into practical applications.

# Problem key sentences

1. We need to avoid the errors that arise from combining model outputs without propagating uncertainty so that we can provide unbiased estimates of key quantitites during infectious disease outbreaks.
2. We need to systematically evaluate infectious disease models and understand their comparative performance and real-time utility across different data sources so that we can inform the design of optimal surveillance systems.
3. We need to establish best practices for using data in future outbreaks so that analysts can use these without having to address potentially complex methodological issues at a time of urgent need.
4. We need to extend our methods to analysing large, complex clinical and individual-level datasets that maximise scientific value from infectious disease surveillance so that potentially key information does not get lost due to computational constraints.
5. We need to evaluate the impact of model assumptions on real-time estimates so that we can accurately characterise conclusions with respect to uncertainty in model structure.
6. We need to translate our methodological advances into practical applications so that these are readily available in future outbreaks.

# Project key sentence

The project will develop, validate and apply composable models for generative modelling of infectious disease dynamics.

# Importance key sentence

In spite of ongoing threats from infectious disease epidemics, current modelling approaches often fragment analyses into disconnected steps, introducing biases that prevent timely and accurate estimates needed for evidence-based outbreak response.
Such biases can be avoided by jointly modelling all relevant processes and data streams, but this usually requires large and complex models that are difficult to extend or adapt to new situations or contexts.

# Promise key sentence

This project aims to enable fast, flexible  and accurate real-time modelling of infectious disease dynamics by connecting reusable model components in the probabilistic programming language (PPL) Turing.

# Next key sentence

We will equip public-health decision makers and researchers with methods that permit timely analysis of emerging data, maximising opportunities for informing the response to threats.
