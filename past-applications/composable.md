## Research summary

*Provide a summary of your proposed research, including key goals, for an expert audience. We will use this as a short abstract and to classify your proposal by subject. We may use it to describe your research on our website and elsewhere (we publish summary details of all our awards). If your application is successful, this summary will be automatically uploaded, without editing, to our website. Take care not to include anything confidential or commercially sensitive.*

*The summary should be as complete as possible within the word limit. Include key words that best describe the research to enable text searching.*

This project will develop a flexible, composable framework for analysing infectious disease dynamics using generative models built in the Julia programming language and the Turing.jl probabilistic programming ecosystem.
Current epidemiological modelling approaches often rely on inflexible models or fragmented pipelines, limiting their ability to integrate diverse data streams and adapt to new questions.
Our approach enables modular, reusable component models that can jointly analyse heterogeneous data, from traditional surveillance to individual-level observations including clinical biomarkers, genomic data, and wastewater signals.
We will revisit early outbreak data, develop scalable inference methods, assess the value of different data streams, and create tools for both routine surveillance and outbreak analysis.
The project includes infrastructure and software development, core epidemiological module design, and targeted applications.
By improving model flexibility, transparency, and accessibility, this work will provide state-of-the-art modelling methods for timely and robust situational awareness in both routine surveillance and emerging outbreaks.
By openly sharing tools and training materials the project will enable integration into epidemiological workflows as well as more efficient use of modelling across the research community.

## Describe how you will undertake your proposed research in an environmentally sustainable way.
*(300 words)*

We will undertake the project in an environmentally sustainable way throughout the research lifecycle by choosing efficient computing, reducing unnecessary travel, and embedding sustainable practices in our collaborations and community engagement.

We will adopt a modular, open-source development approach that promotes code reuse and avoids duplication of effort. All software and model components will be version-controlled and containerised (e.g. via Docker or Singularity) to reduce redundant testing, avoid unnecessary re-computation, and facilitate reproducibility. We will repurpose existing hardware wherever feasible and share computational resources across team members and institutions. We will select data storage strategies that balance access with efficient use of disk and backup systems.

We will use the Green Algorithms calculator and tools identified by RAND Europe to estimate and reduce the carbon footprint of our computational workflows. Our integration with state-of-the-art computation in Julia and associated efficient inference methods  will guarantees numerical efficiency and support scalable inference that avoids wasteful brute-force approaches. 

Our only partner abroad is based at MRC Gambia. We think that including this partner adds a key component by adding an LMIC perspective that will help ensure our approaches are relevant to such settings. Project meetings, seminars and collaborative development will be conducted virtually unless face-to-face contact adds clear value. All essential travel except for partners at MRC Gambia can happen by rail. For the annual workshops we will ask participants to prioritise the use of sustainable transport. Where flights are unavoidable, including possibly for travel to conferences, we will offset carbon emissions.

*You should design your research to use the most sustainable approach you can access within your organisation. See [Wellcome’s Environmental Sustainability Policy](https://wellcome.org/reports/advancing-environmentally-sustainable-health-research) for information on our expectations and some suggested approaches.*
*Include:*

- *how you will reduce, reuse and recycle resources, equipment, materials and consumables*
- *the tools and/or initiatives you will use to measure and reduce the environmental impact of your research. This report by [RAND Europe](https://www.rand.org/randeurope.html) identifies several tools that might be of use.*
- *how you will minimise travel, and the emissions from essential travel, for all grant participants. This includes the grantholder, coapplicants, collaborators and staff employed on the grant and research participants.*

## Enter the total additional cost of undertaking the research, including essential travel, in an environmentally sustainable way.

## Team composition and management

The project will be led by Funk (PI, LSHTM), who will provide the overall scientific and strategic vision and direction. Funk brings extensive leadership experience from a previous Wellcome Senior Research Fellowship, his role as (co-)director of the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID), and from founding and managing the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub. He will ensure coherence across work packages, lead engagement with the wider modelling community and public health stakeholders, and oversee delivery across institutions.

The rationale for the team-based approach reflects the philosophy of composable models: different strands require expertise in complementary areas. Coapplicants have been chosen to reflect these areas whilst ensuring diversity in background, institutional affiliation, and career stage. Each coapplicant will be in charge of a specific work package or project, ensuring ownership and responsibility, with Funk responsible for ensuring communication and progress across the project. 
Our team combines experience in applied Bayesian inference and complex software infrastructure (Abbott, Johnson), user-friendly software packages for public health impact (Cori), probabilistic programming and composability (Ge), phylodynamics (Kraemer), pooled testing (Bah), biomarker and within-host modelling (Kucharski),  wastewater surveillance (Johnson), and integrated modelling of delays and transmission dynamics (Abbott). In addition, our team has wide-ranging experience in working on policy-relevant applications and a large network of collaborators in national and international public health institutions including UKHSA (Funk, Abbott, Cori), RKI (Funk), CDC (Abbott, Johnson), ECDC (Funk), Africa CDC (Bah) and WHO (Funk, Cori) and WHO regional offices (Bah).

At LSHTM, core research will be carried out by Abbott, Johnson, and a third Assistant Professor to be recruited. Working collaboratively, they will each lead on a core technical strand—infrastructure, core modules, and scientific applications, while jointly contributing to applied use cases including scalable inference, comparative data value assessments, and retrospective outbreak analyses. This core team composition has been chosen to give staff transitioning to independence first experience of management and ownership of work packages. This will be complemented by additional opportunities outside of this proposal, e.g. of co-supervision of PhD students who will benefit from the ability to more easily compose models for specific situations that is enabled by the work proposed here. Funk will provide close mentorship throughout as well as integration across the different strands, in addition to bringing additional management capacity where required. Additional mentorship and expertise in infectious disase modelling in Julia will be provided by Frost.

The wider team will collaborate throughout, with regular virtual meetings and annual in-person project meetings with all co-applicants to coordinate activities, share outputs, and align milestones across work packages. Project management support at LSHTM will ensure smooth delivery and reporting, and all team members will contribute to mentoring, co-supervision of junior researchers, and community-building efforts.
