# Summary

## Summary

Our infectious disease modelling tools are fragmented across two organisations with inconsistent interfaces, overlapping functionality, and a distributed maintenance burden, creating barriers to adoption and inefficiencies.
These tools are currently used by major public health agencies, including UKHSA, WHO, CDC, and ECDC for situational awareness of infectious diseases, as well as by multiple independent research groups.
Collectively, they have been downloaded over 100,000 times with significant community engagement and have been cited in over 100 academic papers.

Many of these packages were developed rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritising utility over long-term sustainability.
Users struggle to discover and apply appropriate methods, while developers face significant technical debt and duplicated maintenance efforts.
The ecosystem lacks clear governance and contribution pathways that would allow it to onboard new developers and evolve to match user needs.
Without intervention, these challenges will limit the impact and sustainability of these valuable tools.

This project will unify, harmonise, and establish sustainable governance for our ecosystem of infectious disease modelling tools.
We will systematically address the current challenges through the following key activities:

1. **Creating a unified ecosystem** with a single entry point for packages across both organisations, providing clear signposts for users and establishing a unified roadmap that ensures ongoing relevance and funding opportunities.

2. **Standardising user interfaces** by seeking user and developer feedback on the divergent approaches across packages to enable consistent, intuitive interactions.

3. **Establishing formal governance structures** for the unified ecosystem to support sustainable maintenance, facilitate decision making, and enable broader community participation.

4. **Reducing code duplication** by identifying and implementing shared components across packages, improving interoperability and creating sustainable pathways for maintenance with next-generation frameworks.

5. **Building community capacity** through improved contribution guides, onboarding materials, and infrastructure that facilitates communication across the ecosystem, plus targeted workshops for both new developers and users.

Our approach involves creating shared statistical components that can be implemented once and reused across multiple packages.
This reduces duplication of effort, improves functionality, and enables greater collaboration between developers.
We will identify opportunities for such shared components that reduce maintenance burden while improving the tools' capabilities.

Through these activities, we will provide public health agencies and researchers with a more coherent, maintainable set of tools for infectious disease modelling, enabling more effective responses to both routine surveillance and emerging threats across diverse global settings.
The project directly addresses the sustainability challenges facing these widely-used tools, ensuring they remain available and effective for supporting UK and global health security.
